# Reline
Reline is an esoteric programming language with the goal of making it exceedingly difficult to reason about the control flow of a program. The language lacks traditional control flow structures such as `if`, `else`, `while` and `for`, and instead supports statements for manipulating the order of the lines of statements of a program.

See [language features](language/LanguageFeatures.md) for (an as of yet incomplete) documentation on individual language features.

See [Reline Language Basics](https://github.com/thinker227/RelineLang/releases/tag/RelineLanguageBasics), a VSCode extension for syntax highlighting and snippets for `.rl` files.

**Development is currently ongoing.**
